  "executiveSummary": "For any investor conditioned by the powerful 30% bull run of 2014, the -4% return of 2015 would come as a significant shock. However, markets operate in cycles, and this year provides a classic case study in how a dominant trend can unravel. The year began with a final, memory-fueled echo of the past bull run, which quickly gave way to a decisive bearish takeover. The story of 2015 is one of fading bullish conviction, aggressive bearish attacks, and a market that ended in a state of apathy and disinterest, clearly signaling a major shift in underlying sentiment.",

      "narrative": "The year began with a final, powerful gasp of bullish enthusiasm. The +6% surge was a direct result of the potent \"bull memory\" carried over from the preceding 10-month rally. This was not a move driven by new, fundamental strength but rather by residual momentum and investor muscle memory. It was a testament to how deeply ingrained the \"buy the dip\" mentality had become after the -3% close of 2014.\nHowever, the lack of genuine underlying strength was immediately revealed by the subsequent +1% gain. This meager follow-through showed that the initial 6% surge was an isolated burst, not the start of a new, sustainable leg up. This two-period sequence marks the definitive end of the great bull market that began in early 2014. The momentum had finally exhausted itself."

      "narrative": "The transition was brutal and decisive. The market was hit with two consecutive, severe blows of -5% each. This was a profoundly significant event. In 2014, even minor pauses were met with aggressive buying. Here, a powerful opening rally was not just nullified but aggressively reversed, signaling a complete regime change.\nThis back-to-back harsh decline served a critical purpose: it erased the bull market memory. The relentless selling pressure overwhelmed anyone attempting to buy the dip, demonstrating that bears were now firmly in control. This was not a correction; it was a statement of intent from the sellers, establishing a new, dominant downward trend."

      "narrative": "The market's response to the devastating -10% drop was perhaps the most telling indicator of the entire year. The subsequent rally was a timid +3%. A bounce of this size, following such a severe sell-off, is not a sign of recovery but a profound signal of bullish weakness. It clearly communicates a lack of interest and conviction from buyers.\nThis weakness was immediately confirmed as the market could not even sustain this minor gain, promptly falling by -1%. The ensuing +2% gain was merely a reaction to the -1% dip, not a genuine attempt at a rally. You have astutely identified the core message of this phase: the bulls were communicating their intense disinterest. By responding to a massive sell-off with such slow, doubtful, and insignificant upward moves, they sent a clear signal to the bears that there was no meaningful buying pressure left to counter their attacks."

      "narrative": "Having confirmed the absence of any real buying opposition, the bears launched their final, decisive attack. The -6% capitulation was a direct result of the preceding weakness. It was not a sudden shock but a logical conclusion to the bulls' abdication. The bears pushed the market over the edge, confident that no significant support would emerge.\nThe aftermath of this major sell-off was a market devoid of energy. The bears, having expended significant capital in the [-5, -5] and [-6] moves, stepped back. Yet, the bulls remained absent. The final sequence of [0, 1, -1, 0] paints a picture of complete apathy. This is not a market stabilizing for a recovery; it is a market adrift. The bulls are not buying, and the bears are resting. This complete lack of activity and directional conviction signifies a market deeply damaged, with no interest from buyers even at these lower levels."

  "conclusion": "The -4% return of 2015 tells the story of a powerful trend reversal. The year began with the last vestiges of bull market euphoria, but this was quickly and brutally extinguished. The key theme was the failure of the bulls to respond to significant sell-offs, signaling a complete lack of conviction. Their passive and feeble bounces only served to embolden the bears, leading to a final capitulation. The year ended not with a bang, but with a whimper—a state of profound inactivity that confirmed the bears' dominance and set a somber tone for the period ahead"
