The Year of Violent Equilibrium: Deconstructing the 3% Return of 2018
Executive Summary:
The modest 3% return of 2018 completely masks the reality of one of the most volatile and contentious years in the sequence. Following the mature bull market of 2017, this year was defined by a violent tug-of-war between powerful bullish resilience and equally forceful bearish attacks. The market was a battleground where every major advance was met with a symmetrical takedown. The small positive return was not the result of calm, but the net outcome of a fierce, hard-fought stalemate between two nearly equal forces.
Phase 1: The Final Euphoric Extension
Sequence: [ 6 ]
The year began with a powerful +6% surge, which served as the final, euphoric extension of the bull market that had dominated 2017. Paired with the +3% close of the previous year, this [3, 6] sequence represented the culmination of a remarkable 13-month rally. This final burst of optimism, however, pushed the market into deeply over-extended territory, marking the definitive peak of the bull cycle.
Phase 2: The Inevitable and Intense Correction
Sequence: [ -5, -5 ]
What followed was swift and severe. The market was hit with two consecutive, intense drawdowns of -5%. You have correctly identified the reason for this severity: the preceding 13-month rally had occurred with almost no significant "breathing" or consolidation. This intense, back-to-back decline was the market's unavoidable and overdue correction, a violent release of pressure that had built up over more than a year. This move shattered the bullish consensus and reset market dynamics.
Phase 3: The Resilient Bullish Counter-Offensive
Sequence: [ 6, 0, 0, 6, 3 ]
Despite the sharp correction, the bulls were not defeated. Their response was a powerful demonstration of resilience.
The Initial Response: The immediate +6% rally was a strong statement, showing that significant buying power was still present and willing to defend against the downturn.
Building Strength in the Pause: This was followed by two months of 0% change. This was a crucial phase of absorption and stabilization. The bulls were not retreating; they were consolidating their gains and building a foundation for their next move.
The Renewed Push: The strength built during the pause was unleashed in a new rally of +6% and +3%. This was the bulls' maximum effort, a powerful counter-offensive to reclaim control. As you noted, it was as if the bears had allowed this rally to see the full extent of the bulls' strength.
Phase 4: The Bearish Equalizer
Sequence: [ -6, -6 ]
The bears' response to the bulls' impressive [6, 6, 3] rally was a mirror image of bearish force. The market was hit with another harsh, back-to-back decline of -6%. This was not a random sell-off; it was a direct and proportional response. It was the bears' way of stating that for every bullish action, there would be an equal and opposite bearish reaction. This sequence confirmed that the market was no longer a one-way trend but a two-sided battleground where neither force had a decisive advantage.
Phase 5: The Final Standoff
Sequence: [ 6, 0 ]
Even after this devastating takedown, the bulls refused to capitulate. They responded one last time with a resilient +6% bounce, once again nullifying the immediate bearish pressure. The year concluded with a 0% close, a fitting end to a period defined by conflict. It signified a stalemate, a point of equilibrium where neither the bulls nor the bears could land a final, decisive blow.
Conclusion:
The 3% return of 2018 is one of the most deceptive figures in this multi-year analysis. The year was not calm; it was a war. It was a story of a powerful bull run ending, followed by a series of major rallies and equally major sell-offs. The market's character was one of violent oscillations between bullish conviction and bearish control. The final result was a hard-fought draw, leaving the market in a state of tense equilibrium with no clear victor.
