  "executiveSummary": "The year 2017 delivered a powerful 30% return, establishing itself as a classic, mature bull market. Its foundation was laid not in a dramatic surge, but in the deep consolidation of late 2016 and the proven resilience of the reactionary rally that preceded it. This bull market was not characterized by the explosive, wild swings of a new trend, but by methodical consistency, an intolerance for even minor weakness, and the strategic use of pauses to fuel subsequent advances. It was a year defined by quiet confidence and relentless, steady progress.",

      "narrative": "The bull market of 2017 did not begin with a bang, but with a display of quiet, relentless strength. The initial five-month sequence of [4, 3, 3, 1, 3] is the hallmark of a confident, mature trend. There were no explosive, double-digit gains; instead, the market advanced with a steady, grinding consistency.\nThis phase is crucial because it demonstrates a market that is building a solid foundation. The gains were broad-based and persistent, showing a clear lack of any significant selling pressure. While one might not label it a \"strong\" bull market based on the magnitude of individual moves, its true strength lay in its unwavering consistency and its refusal to give any ground. This slow but steady accumulation set a powerful underlying tone for the entire year."

      "narrative": "After five consecutive periods of gains, the market experienced a minor -1% dip. In a weak or uncertain market, this might signal the start of a larger pullback. In the context of this bull market, however, it served as a trigger.\nThe response was a powerful +6% surge. This is a classic characteristic of a strong bull market, reminiscent of the dynamics seen in 2014. The market treats any sign of weakness, even a negligible pause, as an aggressive buying opportunity. This overreaction to a minor dip is a clear signal of immense underlying demand and bullish conviction. It communicates that a large pool of capital is waiting to be deployed, and any small discount is met with disproportionate force. This single sequence powerfully reaffirmed the dominant bullish trend."

      "narrative": "A powerful surge like +6% often requires a period of digestion. This came in the form of two consecutive -1% pauses. These were not signs of weakness but healthy, shallow consolidations. The market was absorbing the large gain without giving back any significant ground.\nOnce again, the market demonstrated its intolerance for prolonged inactivity. The response to this two-period pause was another strong and healthy advance of +5%. This sequence reinforces the year's primary theme: the market was using pauses strategically to build energy for its next leg up. The bulls were not just reacting; they were in complete control, dictating the pace and rhythm of the advance."

      "narrative": "The year concluded with a final demonstration of this established pattern. Following the +5% rally, the market took another brief -1% pause. This was not even a breather but a momentary consolidation.\nThe bulls once again showed they were taking even these minor dips seriously, responding with a solid +3% gain to close out the period. This final move was a fitting end to the year, encapsulating its core character: steady, confident, and always ready to turn a small pause into a renewed advance."

  "conclusion": "The 30% return of 2017 was the result of a perfectly executed mature bull market. It was built on a foundation of consistency, where the absence of drawdowns was more significant than the magnitude of any single rally. The year's defining feature was its powerful and positive overreaction to any minor pause or dip, demonstrating deep-seated confidence and demand. By strategically using shallow consolidations to fuel its next advance, the market marched steadily higher, rewarding investors with substantial returns without the gut-wrenching volatility of a younger, less certain trend"
